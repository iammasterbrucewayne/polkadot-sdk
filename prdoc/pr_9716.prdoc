title: 'Polkadot: Verify the workers at node startup'
doc:
- audience: Node Operator
  description: |-
    Adds landlock, seccomp, user namespace unshare + chroot, and secure clone checks during polkadot node startup, alongside the existing
    version checks. This ensures that misconfigured or unsupported environments fail early. Non-Linux hosts skip these probes.
